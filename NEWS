openxlsx 1.0.4
----------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* write.xlsx function to write data directly to file via the writeData function
allowing optional basic cell styling.

* writeDataTable now styles columns of class 'Date', 'POSIXct', 'POSIXt', 'currency', 'accounting'
 as Excel formats Date, Date, Date, Currency, accounting respectively.

* Data of class 'Date', 'POSIXct', 'POSIXt', 'currency', 'accounting' are converted to integers
 upon writing (as opposed to characters).


BUG FIXES

* conversion of numeric data to integer in read.xlsx fixed.

* readWorkbook/read.xlsx should work now. Empty values are 
  now padded with NA. Many other bugs fixed.

* borders on single row and/or column data.frames now work.

* readWorkbook/read.xlsx check for TRUE/FALSE values is now case-insensitive.

* sheet names containing invalid xml charcters (&, <, >, ', ") now work when referencing
  by name and will not result in a corrupt workbook.


VIGNETTE

* Instructions for installing Rtools and adding Rtools/bin directory to system PATH variable

* Extra bracket in example and addWorksheet gridLines parameter corrected.
